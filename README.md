# RSAEncryptionDemo
A couple demos of RSA Encryption through console

Using C#, includes an implementation that runs RSA with guaranteed primes (can handle up to roughly 32-48 bits)
Contains a standard (Miller-Rabin) implementation that can do RSA-2048 in roughly 10 seconds or RSA-1024 roughly instantly
